About Me

Hey there! I'm Heshan Rajitha, a Sri Lankan tech wizard who loves turning caffeine into code. With a BEng (Hons) in Software Engineering from London Metropolitan University, I juggle servers, craft sleek websites, and tame wild bugs. When I'm not coding, I'm probably debugging my life choices.
